# Image Pixel Vectorizer

## Overview

The Image Pixel Vectorizer is an innovative Python project designed to offer a unique approach to image processing. With a focus on blurring images using a pixel-based technique, this project showcases the power of computational methods in manipulating visual data. By harnessing the computational capabilities of Python, this project brings forth a simple yet effective solution for achieving image blur effects.

## Project Details

The concept behind the Image Pixel Vectorizer project stems from the fundamental principles of image processing. By treating images as grids of pixels, each with its own color value, the project aims to modify these values systematically to create a blurred effect. This approach draws inspiration from traditional image editing techniques while leveraging the flexibility and efficiency of programming languages like Python.

### Motivation

The motivation behind developing the Image Pixel Vectorizer project lies in its potential applications across various domains. From artistic photo manipulation to enhancing the privacy of sensitive information in images, the ability to blur images programmatically opens up a myriad of possibilities. Additionally, by exploring novel methods of image manipulation, this project contributes to the broader field of computer vision and image processing.

### Blur Algorithm

At the heart of the Image Pixel Vectorizer project lies a sophisticated blur algorithm. This algorithm operates by iteratively processing each pixel in the input image and calculating its blurred counterpart based on the RGB values of neighboring pixels. By averaging these RGB values, the algorithm effectively blends the colors of adjacent pixels, resulting in a smoother, blurred appearance.

## Features

### Pixel-Based Blur

The primary feature of the Image Pixel Vectorizer project is its pixel-based blur functionality. Unlike traditional blur filters that operate on predefined kernel matrices, this approach offers a more granular level of control by considering individual pixels and their immediate surroundings. This pixel-centric approach results in a nuanced blur effect that preserves image details while smoothing out imperfections.

### Customizable Blur Intensity

One of the key advantages of the Image Pixel Vectorizer project is its customizable blur intensity. By adjusting the radius of neighboring pixels considered during the blurring process, users can fine-tune the level of blur applied to an image. This flexibility empowers users to achieve a wide range of visual effects, from subtle enhancements to dramatic transformations.

### Image Format Compatibility

The Image Pixel Vectorizer project supports various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and more. This compatibility ensures that users can seamlessly integrate the project into their existing workflows and work with images in their preferred formats. Whether processing photographs, digital artwork, or screenshots, the project offers versatile support for diverse image types.

## Usage

### Installation

Getting started with the Image Pixel Vectorizer project is straightforward. Users need to ensure they have Python installed on their system and clone the project repository to their local machine. Once downloaded, installing the necessary dependencies is as simple as running a single command.

### Dependencies

The project relies on a minimal set of dependencies, all of which are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Users can install these dependencies using a package manager like pip, ensuring that the project's dependencies are met without hassle.

### Running the Program

Executing the Image Pixel Vectorizer project is as easy as running a Python script with the path to the input image as an argument. Users can specify the input image they wish to blur, and the project takes care of the rest. By following a few simple steps, users can quickly generate blurred versions of their images.

### Adjusting Blur Intensity

One of the key advantages of the Image Pixel Vectorizer project is its customizable blur intensity. Users can modify the `N` parameter in the code to control the number of neighboring pixels considered during the blurring process. By experimenting with different values of `N`, users can fine-tune the blur effect to suit their preferences and achieve the desired level of visual impact.

### Viewing Output

Upon running the Image Pixel Vectorizer project, users can expect the blurred image to be saved in the same directory as the input image. The output image, named `blurred_image.jpg`, showcases the results of the blur algorithm applied to the input image. Users can easily compare the original and blurred images to assess the effectiveness of the blurring process.

## Example

To illustrate the usage of the Image Pixel Vectorizer project, consider the following example:

```bash
python image_pixel_vectorizer.py example_image.jpg
